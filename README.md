# Alien vs. Zombie

Here's a brief introduction to a 2D side-scrolling game featuring Aliens Versus Zombies in C++:

In this game, the player takes on the role of an alien who must navigate through a world infested with zombies. The player must use their abilities to avoid obstacles and defeat the zombies in order to progress through the game.

The game will be written in C++ using Visual Studio Code to handle the gameboard and user input. The player's character will be animated and move left or right, power-ups, health and attack. The zombies will be randomly generated and patrol the levels. The player must dodge their attacks and use their turns to defeat them.

As the player progresses through the levels, the difficulty will increase with more zombies and more challenging obstacles to

The game will have a classic arcade-style feel with retro graphics and sound effects. The goal is to create a text-based,
a simplified version of the Alien Path game based on the given requirements

My Team would like to share a YouTube video  that demonstrates a 2D side-paced game featuring Alien Versus Zombie. The link is attached for your reference *latest progress date 
:19/02/2023- [Video Demo](https://youtube.com).

## Compilation Instructions
```
1. Begin by downloading the 'main.cpp' file from the GitHub repository.
2. Once the file has been successfully downloaded, open it using Local Visual Studio Code.

2. In the terminal window, navigate to the directory in which the 'main.cpp' file is stored.
3. To initiate the compilation process, enter the command 'g++ main.cpp' into the terminal.
3. The compilation process will commence and, if there are no errors in the code, an executable file will be generated.
4. Finally, you can then run the generated executable file to execute the program, bringing your code to life."
